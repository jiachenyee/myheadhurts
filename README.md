# my head hurts
my neurologist told me to create a headache journal, not sure if this is what she meant

pardon the poor code quality, im literally writing this app with a headache

## roadmap
- [x] log headache episodes
- [x] show statistics for number of reports
- [x] crud haedache episodes
- [ ] healthkit symptom tracking integation
  - [ ] entries from the app will be reflected in the health app and vice-versa
- [ ] data vis
  - [ ] maybe a cool headache heatmap like github, that sounds like a headache to implement
  - [ ] trends, like oh no more severe headaches this wk than last
- [ ] usability improvements
  - [ ] support for control center action to quickly headache
  - [ ] support for siri shortcuts so you can use the action button to log headache
  - [ ] support for widgets - maybe it can display the home screen stats
