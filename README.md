# my head hurts
my neurologist told me to create a headache journal, not sure if this is what she meant

pardon the poor code quality, im literally writing this app with a headache

## roadmap
- [x] log headache episodes
- [x] show statistics for number of reports
- [x] crud haedache episodes
- [x] healthkit symptom tracking integation
  - [x] entries from the app will be reflected in the health app
  - [x] edits from the app get updated in the health app
- [x] data vis
  - [x] maybe a cool headache heatmap like github, that sounds like a headache to implement
  - [x] trends, like oh no more severe headaches this wk than last
- [x] usability improvements
  - [x] support for control center action to quickly headache
  - [x] support for siri shortcuts so you can use the action button to log headache
  - [x] support for widgets - maybe it can display the home screen stats
- [x] iCloud syncing
